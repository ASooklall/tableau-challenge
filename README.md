## Purpose:
* To provide insight on the trends among age groups and genders for CitiBike riders in the Jersey City area. Current data (2019) will be analyzed to show current user statistics and indicate areas in which advertisement should be improved/focused as well as areas that aren't as popular and should be reviewed for improvement/removal.
* A strong theory is that, since the Jersey City area has a strong workforce of middle aged working class males, this will be the predominant user group for current data.

## Analysis: 
### Station Popularity

* As shown above, Grove St. Path is by far the most popular station for both starting and ending trips.
* While Union St, and Jackson Square are among the least popular starting stations, their usage statistics are still high on average relevant to other data at 89 and 96 users on average, respectively. 
* On the other hand, 7 stations on the end station list have less than 3 average users. These stations would be good targets for consolidation, advertising, or removal.


### Station Analysis

* The majority of users are in the 30-39 age group, bike less than 5 minutes per trip, and are male subscribers.
* While the majority of the userbase is in the 30-39 group, other groups do have a well proportioned makeup. However, users under 20 have neglibile representation so CitiBike is missing out on the majority of the possible younger userbase.
* Subscribers dwarf the amount of per-basis customers with an overwhelming 92% which is the goal from a service standpoint.
* Males have a 70% majority compared to the female userbase of under 25%. This indicated a need to increase female userbase.

### User Demographics

* The majority (72%) of subscribers are male within the 30-39 age group and bike less than 5 minutes per trip. This could be due to the large population of working class males in the area.
* For the userbase to become more varied, there needs to be stations in places that have utility for other demographics.

* While the majority of customers (non-subscribers) are still male, the makeup is more varied. However, there is a large proportion of users that do no provide their gender so this data may be skewed.
* The age group of customers is far more varied and a large increase in the 40-49 age group can be seen. This shows that workers in the area most likely prefer to subscribe and there is use among other age groups that aren't subscribers. However, users under 20 still show neglibile numbers.
