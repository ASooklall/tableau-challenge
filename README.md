## Purpose:
* To provide insight on the trends among age groups and genders for CitiBike riders in the Jersey City area. Current data (2019) will be analyzed to show current user statistics and indicate areas in which advertisement should be improved/focused as well as areas that aren't as popular and should be reviewed for improvement/removal.
* A strong theory is that, since the Jersey City area has a strong workforce of middle aged working class males, this will be the predominant user group for current data.

## Analysis:

### Station Analysis

* As shown above, Grove St. Path is by far the most popular station for both starting and ending trips.
* While Union St, and Jackson Square are among the least popular starting stations, their usage statistics are still high on average relevant to other data at 89 and 96 users on average, respectively. 
* On the other hand, 7 stations on the end station list have less than 3 average users. These stations would be good targets for consolidation, advertising, or removal.
