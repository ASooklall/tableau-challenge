## Purpose:
* To provide insight on the trends among age groups and genders for CitiBike riders in the Jersey City area. Current data (2019) will be analyzed to show current user statistics and indicate areas in which advertisement should be improved/focused as well as areas that aren't as popular and should be reviewed for improvement/removal.
* A strong theory is that, since the Jersey City area has a strong workforce of middle aged working class males, this will be the predominant user group for current data.

## Analysis: 
### Station Popularity

* As shown above, Grove St. Path is by far the most popular station for both starting and ending trips.
* While Union St, and Jackson Square are among the least popular starting stations, their usage statistics are still high on average relevant to other data at 89 and 96 users on average, respectively. 
* On the other hand, 7 stations on the end station list have less than 3 average users. These stations would be good targets for consolidation, advertising, or removal.


### Station Analysis

* The majority of users are in the 30-39 age group, bike less than 5 minutes per trip, and are male subscribers.
* While the majority of the userbase is in the 30-39 group, other groups do have a well proportioned makeup. However, users under 20 have neglibile representation so CitiBike is missing out on the majority of the possible younger userbase.
* Subscribers dwarf the amount of per-basis customers with an overwhelming 92% which is the goal from a service standpoint.
* Males have a 70% majority compared to the female userbase of under 25%. This indicated a need to increase female userbase.

### User Demographics
<img src="/images/CitiBike-StationDB-subscriberStats.png" alt="Subscribers" width="1024" height="768">

* The majority (72%) of subscribers are male within the 30-39 age group and bike less than 5 minutes per trip. This could be due to the large population of working class males in the area.
* For the userbase to become more varied, there needs to be stations in places that have utility for other demographics.

<img src="/images/CitiBike-StationDB-customerPref.png" alt="Customers" width="1024" height="768">

* While the majority of customers (non-subscribers) are still male, the makeup is more varied. However, there is a large proportion of users that do no provide their gender so this data may be skewed.
* The age group of customers is far more varied and a large increase in the 40-49 age group can be seen. This shows that workers in the area most likely prefer to subscribe and there is use among other age groups that aren't subscribers. However, users under 20 still show neglibile numbers. 

### User Preferences
<img src="/images/CitiBike-StationDB-distanceUsers.png" alt="distanceUsers" width="1024" height="768">

* For users that travel for more than 5 mins per trip, we can see a more even division among customers vs. subscribers.
* The age groups for these users are also more varied and there is a non-negligible amount of users above the age of 60.
* This would be a good target for increasing userbase by making longer rides more accessible/comfortable.

* Here you can see that the users under 20 are male-majority and more subscribers than customers. 
* While the distances are more varied, there are only two starting and two ending locations for these users.
* These areas (Baldwin at Montgomery and Sip Ave) would be strong areas for increasing the younger population.

### Gender Analysis

* This visualization shows the breakdown of gender among users in a more detailed view. The next two visualizations will break these down per individual gender.

<img src="/images/CitiBike-GenderDB-males.png" alt="GenderDB-Male" width="1024" height="768">

* This visualization shows the most popular stations for males in the 30-39 age group. 
* These stations would be good targets for increasing and maintaining the large male population.

<img src="/images/CitiBike-GenderDB-females.png" alt="GenderDB-Female" width="1024" height="768">

* The majority of female users are between the ages of 20-39.
* This visualization shows the stations these females frequent and would provide a good target for increasing the female userbase.

## Conclusion:
* As theorized, the majority of the userbase is of the middle aged, working class males that subscribe to this service.
* While there is a considerable female userbase present, this group needs to be expanded upon with proper advertising and increased attractions.
* A userbase needs to be developed among users under the age of 20.
    * This can be done by increasing the utility of stations in the Baldwin and Sip Ave. locations and also areas around universities and schools.
* Distance riders are a good target for increasing user population as they have a more expansive makeup among age groups.
    * Increasing availability of stations and bikes for these trips, as well as comfortability and safety during these trips are strong options.
